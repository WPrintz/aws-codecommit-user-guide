# Share an AWS CodeCommit Repository<a name="how-to-share-repository"></a>

After you have created an AWS CodeCommit repository, you can share it with other users\. First, decide which protocol to recommend to users when connecting to your repository: HTTPS or SSH\. Then send the URL and connection information to the users with whom you want to share the repository\. Depending on your security requirements, sharing a repository may also require creating an IAM group, applying managed policies to that group, and editing IAM policies to refine access\. This topic will walk you through these steps\.

These instructions assume you have already completed the steps in [Setting Up ](setting-up.md) and [Create a Repository](how-to-create-repository.md)\. 

**Note**  
Depending on your usage, you might be charged for creating or accessing a repository\. For more information, see [Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/pricing) on the AWS CodeCommit product information page\.

## Choose the Connection Protocol to Share with Your Users<a name="how-to-share-repo-choose"></a>

When you create a repository in AWS CodeCommit, two endpoints are generated: one for HTTPS connections and one for SSH connections\. Both provide secure connections over a network\. Your users can use either protocol\. Both endpoints remain active regardless of which protocol you recommend to your users\.

HTTPS connections require either Git credentials, which IAM users can generate for themselves in IAM, or an AWS access key, which your repository users must configure in the credential helper included in the AWS CLI but is the only method available for root account or federated users\. Git credentials are the easiest method for users of your repository to set up and use\. SSH connections require your users to generate a public\-private key pair, store the public key, associate the public key with their IAM user, configure their known hosts file on their local computer, and create and maintain a config file on their local computers\. Because this is a more complex configuration process, we recommend you choose HTTPS and Git credentials for connections to AWS CodeCommit\.

For more information about HTTPS, SSH, Git, and remote repositories, see [Setting Up ](setting-up.md) or consult your Git documentation\. For a general overview of communication protocols and how each communicates with remote repositories, see [Git on the Server \- The Protocols](http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html)\.

**Note**  
Although Git supports a variety of connection protocols, AWS CodeCommit does not support connections with unsecured protocols, such as the local protocol or generic HTTP\.

## Create IAM Policies for Your Repository<a name="how-to-share-repo-create-policy"></a>

AWS provides three managed policies in IAM for AWS CodeCommit\. These policies cannot be edited and apply to all repositories associated with your AWS account\. However, you can use these policies as templates to create your own custom managed policies that apply only to the repository you want to share\. Your customer managed policy can apply specifically to the repository you want to share\. For more information about managed policies and IAM users, see [Managed Polices](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) and [IAM Users and Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html)\. 

**Tip**  
For more fine\-grained control over access to your repository, you can create more than one customer managed policy and apply the policies to different IAM users and groups\.

To review the contents of the policy and the other managed policies for AWS CodeCommit and learn more about creating and applying permissions by using policies, see [Authentication and Access Control for AWS CodeCommit](auth-and-access-control.md)\.

**Create a customer managed policy for your repository**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the **Dashboard** navigation area, choose **Policies**, and then choose **Create Policy**\. 

1. On the **Create Policy** page, to the right of the **Visual Editor** and **JSON** tab, choose **Import managed policy**\.

1. In the **Import managed policies** window, type **AWSCodeCommitPowerUser** in the **Search Policies** search box\. Select the radio button next to that policy and click **Import** at the bottom of the window\.

1. On the **Review Policy** page, in **Policy Name**, type a new name for the policy \(for example, *AWSCodeCommitPowerUser\-MyDemoRepo*\)\.

   In the **Policy Document** text box, replace the "\*" portion of the `Resource` line with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the AWS CodeCommit repository\. For example:

   ```
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyDemoRepo"
    ]
   ```
**Tip**  
To find the ARN for the AWS CodeCommit repository, go to the AWS CodeCommit console and choose the repository name from the list\. For more information, see [View Repository Details](how-to-view-repository-details.md)\.

   If you want this policy to apply to more than one repository, add each repository as a resource by specifying its ARN\. Include a comma between each resource statement, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyDemoRepo",
    "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyOtherDemoRepo"
    ]
   ```

1. Choose **Validate Policy**\. After it is validated, choose **Create Policy**\.
**Tip**  
Creating a managed policy for a repository does not supply additional permissions required for individual users to set up Git credentials or SSH keys in IAM\. You must apply these managed policies to individual IAM users\.  
To allow users to use Git credentials to connect to AWS CodeCommit, select the **IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCredentials** and **IAMReadOnlyAccess** managed policies and apply them to your users\.
To allow users to use SSH to connect to AWS CodeCommit, select the **IAMUserSSHKeys** and **IAMReadOnlyAccess** managed policies and apply them to your users\.

## Create an IAM Group for Repository Users<a name="how-to-share-repository-IAMgroup"></a>

To manage access to your repository, create an IAM group for its users, add IAM users to that group, and then attach the customer managed policy you created in the previous step\. 

If you use SSH, you must attach another managed policy to the IAMUserSSHKeys group, the IAM managed policy that allows users to upload their SSH public key and associate it with the IAM user they use to connect to AWS CodeCommit\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the **Dashboard** navigation area, choose **Groups**, and then choose **Create New Group**\. 

1. On the **Set Group Name** page, in the **Group Name** box, type a name for the group \(for example, *MyDemoRepoGroup*\), and then choose **Next Step**\. Consider including the repository name as part of the group name\.
**Note**  
This name must be unique across an AWS account\.

1. Select the check box next to the customer managed policy you created in the previous section \(for example, **AWSCodeCommitPowerUser\-MyDemoRepo**\)\. 

   + If your users will use HTTPS and Git credentials to connect to AWS CodeCommit, select the check boxes next to **IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCredentials** and **IAMReadOnlyAccess**, and then choose **Next Step**\. 

   + If your users will use SSH to connect to your repository, select the check boxes next to **IAMUserSSHKeys** and **IAMReadOnlyAccess**, and then choose **Next Step**\.

1. On the **Review** page, choose **Create Group**\. The group will be created in IAM with the specified policies already attached\. It will appear in the list of groups associated with your AWS account\.

1. Choose your group from the list\. 

1. On the group summary page, choose the **Users** tab, and then choose **Add Users to Group**\. On the list that shows all users associated with your AWS account, select the check boxes next to the users to whom you want to allow access to the AWS CodeCommit repository, and then choose **Add Users**\.
**Tip**  
You can use the Search box to quickly find users by name\.

1. When you have added your users, close the IAM console\.

## Share the Connection Information with Your Users<a name="how-to-share-repository-cli"></a>

1. Open the AWS CodeCommit console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codecommit](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codecommit)\.

1. In the region selector, choose the region where the repository was created\. Repositories are specific to an AWS region\. For more information, see [Regions and Git Connection Endpoints](regions.md)\.

1. On the **Dashboard** page, choose the name of the repository you want to share\. 

1. On the **Code** page, choose **Clone URL**, and then choose the protocol you want your users to use\. 

1. Copy the displayed URL for the connection protocol your users will use when connecting to your AWS CodeCommit repository\. 

1. Send your users the connection information along with any other instructions, such as installing the AWS CLI, configuring a profile, or installing Git\. Make sure to include the configuration information for the connection protocol \(for example, for HTTPS, configuring the credential helper for Git\)\. 

The following example email provides information for users connecting to the MyDemoRepo repository with the HTTPS connection protocol and Git credentials in the US East \(Ohio\) \(us\-east\-2\) region\. This email assumes the user has already installed Git and is familiar with using it:

```
I've created an AWS CodeCommit repository for us to use while working on our project. 
The name of the repository is MyDemoRepo, and
it is in the  US East (Ohio) (us-east-2) region. 
Here's what you need to do in order to get started using it:

1. Make sure that your version of Git on your local computer is 1.7.9 or later.
2. Generate Git credentials for your IAM user by signing into the IAM console here: [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). 
Switch to the Security credentials tab for your IAM user and choose the Generate button in HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit. 
Make sure to save your credentials in a secure location!
3. Switch to a directory of your choice and clone the AWS CodeCommit repository to your local machine by running the following command:
    git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyDemoRepo my-demo-repo
4. When prompted for username and password, use the Git credentials you just saved.          
    
That's it!  If you'd like to learn more about using AWS CodeCommit, you can start with the tutorial [here](getting-started.md#getting-started-create-commit).
